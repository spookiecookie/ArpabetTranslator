It was past one o'clock when Pierre left his friend. It was a cloudless, northern, summer night.
Pierre took an open cab intending to drive straight home. But the nearer he drew to the house
the more he felt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night. It was light enough to see a
long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like morning or evening than night. But he
immediately recalled his promise to Prince Andrew not to go there. Then, as happens to people
of weak character, he desired so passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so
accustomed to that he decided to go. The thought immediately occurred to him that his promise
to Prince Andrew was of no account, because before he gave it he had already promised Prince
Anatole to come to his gathering; "besides," though he, "all such 'words of honor' are
conventional things with no definite meaning, especially if one considers that by tomorrow one
may be dead, or something so extraordinary may happen to one that honor and
dishonor will be all the same!‚Äù (From War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.)
